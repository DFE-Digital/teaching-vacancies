        description: <<~DESCRIPTION,
          This document outlines the API’s key features, the data required for each listing,
          and the steps needed to set up an integration.

          This documentation describes each endpoint’s request parameters, response formats, and possible errors,
          so you can seamlessly integrate Teaching Vacancies into your ATS workflow.

          ## Introduction

          The Teaching Vacancies application tracking system (ATS) API enables you to manage job listings on behalf of schools or trusts through your own ATS or HR software.

          This guidance explains the main features of the API, the data needed for each job listing, and how to set up an integration.

          We'll also cover the request parameters, response formats and potential errors for each endpoint, so you can easily integrate Teaching Vacancies into your ATS workflow.

          ### How it works

          1. Schools post job applications to the ATS platform.
          2. ATS servers make requests to API endpoints.
          3. Teaching Vacancies get job listings and display them on the service.
          4. People looking for school jobs can search for and get alerts for job listings and can click through the ATS website to learn more.

          By calling this API, you can:

          - **List** all your active vacancies (with pagination)
          - **Retrieve** details for a single vacancy
          - **Create** new vacancies
          - **Update** existing vacancies
          - **Delete** vacancies if they need to be removed before their expiration date

          ## Authentication

          Each request requires a valid API key in the `X-Api-Key` header to ensure only authorised
          clients can manage vacancies.

          Include this key in the `X-Api-Key` header of each request.
          If the key is missing or invalid, the API will respond with an `HTTP 401` (Unauthorized) status.

          This ensures that only approved clients can create, update, or remove job listings.
          If you ever need a new or replacement key, let us know, and we’ll assist you with the process.
          You can email us at [teachingvacancies.ats@education.gov.uk](mailto:teachingvacancies.ats@education.gov.uk).
