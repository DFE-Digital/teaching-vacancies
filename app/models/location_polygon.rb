  # British National Grid SRID (EPSG:27700) is a projected coordinate system used for mapping in Great Britain.
  # It provides coordinates in meters, which is useful for distance calculations, which we need
  # for radius-based searches.
  # It is significantly more accurate for distance calculations in Great Britain that EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator).
  # EPSG:3857 distort distances and areas, especially as you move away from the equator. What would cause a multiplier
  # between 1.5x and 1.7x for radius/buffer distances in our case to get the matches we would expect.
