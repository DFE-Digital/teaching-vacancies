# Parses a user's search query into a syntax tree which can later be transformed into an Arel AST
#
# We use a managed Postgres database  and it does not support custom synonym
# dictionaries for full-text search (because we do not get filesystem access on the database
# server which Postgres requires for loading dictionaries). This means we can't just add a
# synonym dictionary/thesaurus to Postgres, use `websearch_to_tsquery`, and call it a day - instead
# we need to parse our own queries and take synonyms into account when doing so.
#
# The silver lining is we have full control over query parsing and can implement arbitrary query
# syntax in the future.
