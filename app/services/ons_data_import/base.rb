  # The higher the value, the less vertices the polygon will have. Less vertices means less precision but faster.

  # polygon (tested original vs simplified outputs in geojson.io).
  # EG: The original Cornwall polygon from ONS has 125k vertices, the simplified version with 0.001 tolerance has 2.5k
  # vertices, while retaining the same shape.
