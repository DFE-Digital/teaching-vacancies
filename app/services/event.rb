# Represents events occurring within the application that we are interested in tracking.

# At a minimum, an event has a type and a timestamp at which it occurred. It may also have optional
# metadata that describes what occurred in more detail. Events are asynchronously sent to our data
# warehouse using a background job. An instance of `Event` can trigger an arbitrary number of
# events (to allow for potentially expensive computation on initialization of subclasses).
