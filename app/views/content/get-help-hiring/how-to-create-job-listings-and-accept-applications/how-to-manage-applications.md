## Managing applications

When you use the Teaching Vacancies application form to list your school’s jobs, there are a few different ways to access and manage job applications.

## Accessing applications through your notifications

When you receive a new application for an active job listing, you will get a notification. If you are signed in to Teaching Vacancies, you can view your notifications by selecting ‘Notifications’ on the service navigation bar.

When you get a notification about a new application, you can select the link within the notification to open the new application.

## Accessing applications through job listings

When you review your active job listings, you can either select the job title and then ‘Applications’ or select ‘View applicants’ to directly access the applicant dashboard. There are 5 sections on the dashboard:

* new
* not progressing
* shortlisted
* interviewing
* job offered

If you have not opened or updated an application yet, it will have the following label applied:

* unread – these applications are in the ‘New’ section of the dashboard

Select an applicant’s name to view their application in full, download their application, or update their application status.

## Updating an application status

To update the status of one application, select the checkbox next to the applicant’s name and then select the ‘Update application status’ button.

To update multiple applications at the same time, select the checkbox beside each applicant’s name and select the ‘Update application status’ button. You can only perform this action for multiple applications if you are moving all the selected applicants to the same stage.

When you select ‘Update application status’, you will have the option to move applicants to one of these sections of the dashboard:

* not progressing – applications that you are not going to move forward to interview or applications that have been withdrawn by the jobseeker
* shortlisted – applications that you want to shortlist
* interviewing – applications that you are taking to interview stage
* job offered – the application of the person you have offered the job to

You can move a candidate to the ‘Not progressing’ stage after they have been shortlisted, but you cannot reinstate candidates once they have been moved to the ‘Not progressing’ stage.

When you move a candidate to the ‘Interviewing’ stage, you will be asked if you want to collect their references and self-disclosure form using Teaching Vacancies.

From this point, you will have access to the pre-interview checklist, which will appear under the ‘Application status’ heading in the table. When you select that link, you will be taken to a section of the dashboard where you can track the candidate’s references and self-disclosure form.

Religious references cannot be collected through Teaching Vacancies, but you can manually record them to track their progress.

## Anonymised applications

If you have chosen to make applications for your job listing anonymous, a reference number will be shown instead of the applicant’s name. If an application is shortlisted, you will then be able to view the candidate’s personally identifiable information (PII).

## Downloading data and data protection

To comply with data protection regulations, you will have access to all applications for 6 months.

To download data, you can either select the checkbox next to an application and select the ‘Download application’ button underneath the table or select ‘Download application’ from within the application. If an application is anonymous (and has not been shortlisted), you will received a redacted version of the application to download.

When an application is at the ‘Job offered’ stage, selecting the ‘Download application’ button will download the following data about the candidate:

* their completed application form
* PII
* references
* self-disclosure form
