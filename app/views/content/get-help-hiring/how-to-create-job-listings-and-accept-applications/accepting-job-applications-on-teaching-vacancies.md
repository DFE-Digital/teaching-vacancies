## Why you should use Teaching Vacancies for applications

When posting a new job on our service you’re given the option to use the Teaching Vacancies application form or an alternative application process. We recommend you choose to receive applications through Teaching Vacancies so you can:
 
* set up an application process for your job listing with one click, saving time and money
* receive applicant information in a structured way, making it easier to shortlist candidates
* manage applicants for all your jobs on a single dashboard, whether you’re hiring for a single school or a multi-academy trust
* easily notify successful and unsuccessful candidates
* ensure you’re complying with the most up-to-date recruitment legislation

## The Teaching Vacancies application form 

If you choose to accept applications through Teaching Vacancies, candidates will be asked to complete an online application form.

We've designed the form to help you easily identify high quality candidates, and to ensure your recruitment processes always follow the latest legal requirements related to safeguarding and discrimination.

The form also makes applying easier for candidates. We save information such as their qualifications and work history from their previous applications so they can use it in future ones. 

This allows them to spend more time personalising sections such as their personal statement. 

### Personal details 

As well as basic details such as their name, address and contact information, we give candidates the option to provide their teacher reference number (TRN) and National Insurance number to make it easier for you to verify their eligibility.

### Professional status

Applicants are asked to confirm whether they have qualified teacher status (QTS) and whether they have completed their statutory induction year.

If they are qualified, we ask for the year QTS was awarded. If they’re not, we ask for further details on their current status.

### Qualifications 

Applicants are asked to include their qualifications, including all GCSEs, A levels (or equivalents), undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, and professional courses. They can add as many as they want.

When adding each qualification, we ask them to specify the awarding organisation, the subject(s), the grade(s), and the year it was obtained. If they've not finished studying for a qualification, we ask for further details. 

### Training and continuing professional development (CPD)

Applicants can add any training or CPD they have completed in this section. When they select the option to add training, they are asked to include any training or CPD they have completed within the last 3 years that is relevant to the role they’re applying for.

We ask applicants to provide the name of the course or training and the date it was completed. They have the option to provide the training provider, the course length and the grade they received. They can add as much training or CPD as they want.

### Professional body memberships

Applicants are asked to add any professional body memberships they may have. We ask them for the name of the professional body and if they took an exam to get the membership.

Applicants have the option to provide the membership type or level, their membership or registration number and the date they received the membership. They can add as many professional body memberships as they want.

### Work history 

Applicants are asked to include all jobs they have had since they left full time education. This includes voluntary work if it’s relevant to their application. 

Applicants can add as many roles as they want, each with a summary of their main duties and a start and end date (unless it’s their current role). We automatically detect gaps in employment and will flag these to you on the applications dashboard.

### Personal statement 

We ask applicants to explain why they’re suitable for the role and to include any relevant personal qualities and experiences related to your job description.

If you have included any specific instructions for candidates when setting up your job posting, these will be displayed at this step to help ensure jobseekers submit the necessary information.

### Religious information

This section of the application is shown to candidates who are applying for a role at a faith school.

We let applicants know that schools, academies and colleges of a religious character can give preference to religious applicants when recruiting for teaching roles, but candidates who do not follow a faith or religion are still encouraged to apply.

Applicants are asked how they will meet your school's ethos and aims, and if they are currently following a religion or faith.

### References

We ask applicants to provide the name, job title, organisation and contact details of at least two referees. One of these must be their current or most recent employer. 

If the applicant does not currently work with children, but has done so in the past, they're asked to include a referee from the last time they did so.

### Equal opportunities and recruitment monitoring 

Candidates are asked to provide information on whether they have a disability as well as their age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnic group.

This information is not to be used as part of candidate selection, however it does allow you to anonymously monitor the inclusivity of your recruitment process.

For each question, applicants are given the opportunity to answer ‘Prefer not to say’. For any question where they answer ‘Other', we provide an option to include further details.

### Ask for support if you have a disability or other needs 

Regardless of how they have answered the question regarding disabilities on the previous step, we provide candidates with an opportunity to explain any support they may require if they’re invited to attend an interview. 

This may include adjustments related to a disability, a mental health condition, or educational needs.

### Declarations 

We ask applicants to give details of any connections to the school through their family or close relationships.

We also ask them to confirm whether they have the right to work in the UK.

Applicants are not asked if they are barred from working with children. Department for Education guidance states that applicants should be asked this at the shortlisting stage. This ensures that only school staff who are allowed to have access to this information can see it.

## What happens when an application is submitted? 

Before submitting their application, we ask candidates to confirm that the information they have provided is accurate and that they are happy for their data to be shared with:

* the Department for Education
* the school, trust or local authority which posted the job listing
* the school (or schools) the job is at

Each day you will receive a summary email of any applications that have been made for your active jobs over the previous 24 hours. This will link to your Teaching Vacancies dashboard.

## Managing applications 

When you use the Teaching Vacancies application form to list your school's jobs, there are a few different ways to access and manage job applications.

### Accessing applications through your notifications

When you receive a new application for an [active job listing](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/publishers/sign-in), you will get a notification. If you are signed in to Teaching Vacancies, you can view your notifications by selecting 'Notifications' on the service navigation bar in the top right-hand corner of your screen.

When you get a notification about a new application, you can select the link within the notification to open the new application. You should receive an email summary of all the new notifications you receive from Teaching Vacancies once a day.

### Accessing applications through job listings

When you review your active job listings, you can either select the job title and then 'Applications' or select 'View applicants' to directly access the applicant dashboard. There are 5 sections on the dashboard:

* new
* not progressing
* shortlisted
* interviewing
* job offered

If you have not opened or updated an application yet, it will have the following label applied:

* unread - these applications are in the 'New' section of the dashboard, and are applications you have not yet viewed

Select an applicant's name to view their application in full, download their application, or update their application status.

### Updating an application status

To update the status of one application, select the checkbox next to the applicant's name and then select the 'Update application status' button.

To update multiple applications at the same time, select the checkbox beside each applicant's name and select the 'Update application status' button. You can only perform this action for multiple applications if you are moving all the selected applicants to the same stage.

When you select 'Update application status', you will have the option to move applicants to one of these sections of the dashboard:

* not progressing - applications that you are not going to move forward to inerview or applications that have been withdrawn by the jobseeker
* shortlisted - applications that you want to shortlist
* interviewing - applications that you are taking to interview stage
* job offered - the application of the person you have offered the job to

You can move a candidate to the 'Not progressing' section of the dashboard after they have been shortlisted, but you cannot reinstate candidates once they have been moved to the 'Not progressing' stage.

When you move a candidate to the 'Interviewing' stage,  you will be asked if you want to collect their references and self-disclosure form using Teaching Vacancies. From this point, you will have access to the pre-interview checklist, which will appear under the 'Application status' heading in the table. When you select that link, you will be taken to a section of the dashboard where you can track the candidate's references and self-disclosure form.

Religious references cannot be collected through Teaching Vacancies, but you can manually record them to track their progress.

### Anonymised applications

If you have chosen applications to remain anonymous, there will be a reference number instead of a name. If the application is shortlisted, you will then be able to view the candidate's personally identifiable information (PII).

### Downloading data and data protection

To comply with data protection regulations, you will have access to all applications for 6 months. 

To download data, you can either select the checkbox next to an application and select the 'Download application' button underneath the table or select 'Download application' from within the application. If an application is anonymous (and has not been shortlisted), you will received a redacted version of the application to download.
