You can use Teaching Vacancies to recruit for all roles in your school or trust.

This includes roles such as a finance director, office support staff, site management and more.

The job listing process is almost exactly the same for teaching and non-teaching roles. When you publish a role on Teaching Vacancies, it can also be found on the GOV.UK [Find a job service](https://www.gov.uk/find-a-job).

## Listing a non-teaching role
  1. Select ‘create a job listing’ and choose whether your role is in teaching and leadership, teaching support, or non-teaching support.
  2. Choose either a job title (for example, teaching assistant), or a job category (for example, administration, HR, data and finance). You can choose ‘other leadership roles’ or ‘other support roles’ if the categories don’t fit.

## Leaving feedback
You can leave feedback after you’ve created your job listing.

We’ll also email you after the job listing has ended to ask how you filled your vacancy.

We’re excited to support you with recruiting all roles in your school and look forward to welcoming new jobseekers to Teaching Vacancies.
