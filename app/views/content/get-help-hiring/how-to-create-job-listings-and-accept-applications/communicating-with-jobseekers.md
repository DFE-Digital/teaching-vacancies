## How to send and receive messages using the Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

When you use the Teaching Vacancies application form, you can use the Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to manage your applications and communicate with jobseekers. 

### Accessing your messages 

When you select the ‘Messages’ heading, you will be taken to your message inbox.  

Your ability to send and receive messages to and from jobseekers depends on the application stage:  

* new - you can send a message, but jobseekers cannot contact you first 

* not progressing - you can send a message, but jobseekers will not be able to reply 

* withdrawn - if someone has withdrawn their application, neither of you can send messages 

* shortlisted - you can send a message and jobseekers can reply, but they cannot contact you first 

* interviewing - you or the jobseeker can send and reply to messages 

* job offered - you or the jobseeker can send and reply to messages  

* job offer declined - you or the jobseeker can send and reply to messages 
 
  

Once a day, you will get an email from Teaching Vacancies letting you know how many new messages you have received.  

### Archiving messages 

If you no longer need to keep a message in your inbox, you can move it to the ‘Archive’ section. You can return it to your inbox later if needed by selecting ‘Unarchive message’.   
 
All messages are stored for 6 months before they are automatically deleted. Consider which messages you need to keep for compliance purposes and save a copy in your school or trust’s storage location.
