Teaching Vacancies uses the DfE Sign-in service to manage who is able to post vacancies for each school.

This allows organisation administrators to approve and manage users, granting them access to post and edit job adverts, and respond to candidate applications.

## Logging-in with your DfE Sign-in account

When you [sign in to Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/publishers/sign-in), you will be redirected to the DfE Sign-in page. You can request a [DfE Sign-in account](https://profile.signin.education.gov.uk/register) if you do not already have one.

Your account will show which organisations your email address is associated with. This will either be none, one, or several. If you’re already associated with more than one organisation, you can choose which one you’d like to use to sign into Teaching Vacancies.

If you have access to an organisation but not Teaching Vacancies, you will need to [add the service to your account](#getting-access-to-the-teaching-vacancies-service).

## Getting access to organisations

### Managing vacancies for a single school

If you’re not yet associated with the school you’d like to manage vacancies for, select ‘Request access to an organisation’ from your DfE Sign-in dashboard. Search for the school by name, URN, or UKPRN.

Once you find the school you’re looking for, confirm your request, adding an optional message to the approvers.

You can see the status of your request from your [Organisations](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/organisations) page. If you're waiting on approval and need to find out who is an approver for your school, [contact the DSI support team](https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us).

### Managing vacancies for multiple schools

Each school you have access to is managed through a separate dashboard on Teaching Vacancies.

Alternatively, you can request access to a multi-academy trust (MAT) or local authority (LA), allowing you to manage vacancies for multiple schools from a single dashboard.

They are listed as organisations within DfE Sign-in and can be found in exactly the same way as individual schools by searching for the name of the trust, URN and UKPRN. If you’re approved for access to a MAT or LA, you will be able to post and manage job roles on Teaching Vacancies for all schools associated with that organisation.

Your request will be sent to the MAT or LA approver and you will receive an email confirmation once it has been granted. You can see the status of your request on your [Organisations](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/organisations) page.

## Getting access to the Teaching Vacancies service

When you have been granted access to one or more organisations, go to your [My Services](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/my-services) page and select 'Request access to a service'.

You’ll be asked which organisation you’re requesting a service for (if you have access to more than one) and can then select Teaching Vacancies from the list.

Your request will go back to the approver, and you will be able to see the status on your [My Services](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/my-services) page.


### Accessing Teaching Vacancies as a new free school

A few months before your free school is due to open, your delivery officer will be in touch to get the details of the person you want to be given the initial access to [DfE Sign-in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/). They will receive their DfE Sign-in details once you have successfully completed an Ofsted pre-registration inspection, have a signed funding agreement, and your free school’s status has been changed to ‘proposed to open’ on GIAS. After a request is made, users are granted access to Teaching Vacancies by an approver. 
If you need to add users, [guidance can be found here](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/get-help-hiring/how-to-approve-access-for-hiring-staff). 


New free schools that are part of a multi-academy trust can access Teaching Vacancies earlier to recruit staff for free through MAT Level Access. 

### Accessing Teaching Vacancies as an academy converter 
If you have used Teaching Vacancies before and are converting to an academy, you will need to re-register through your [DfE Sign-in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/) to regain access. You can re-register after receiving your first payment from ESFA. Academies should activate their new DfE Sign-in account and add users to their academy within 28 days of opening. 


Academy converters that are part of a multi-academy trust can access Teaching Vacancies earlier to recruit staff for free through MAT Level Access. 

## Being granted access by an approver

It’s possible for organisation administrators to grant users access to services directly, rather than requiring individuals to make a request.

If you are an approver at a school, MAT or LA, [find out how to give hiring staff access to Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/get-help-hiring/how-to-approve-access-for-hiring-staff).

## Get help

If you’re not getting a response from your approver, you can [submit a support request through the DfE Sign-In Help page](https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us). We are unable to assist with the approvals process through Teaching Vacancies.
