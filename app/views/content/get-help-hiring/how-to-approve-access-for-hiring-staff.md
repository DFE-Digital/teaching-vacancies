Access to Teaching Vacancies is managed through [DfE Sign-in](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/), which allows organisation administrators to manage various services provided by the Department for Education.

If hiring staff from a school, multi-academy trust (MAT) or local authority (LA) need to post a job on Teaching Vacancies, they can only do so after being granted access by an approver at the relevant organisation.

This guidance is for account approvers who grant people access to accounts and services. If you require approval rights and are looking to post jobs, [read our guidance on requesting access to organisations on Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/get-help-hiring/how-to-request-organisation-access).

## Granting access to users
The quickest way to enable hiring staff to post jobs on Teaching Vacancies is to give them access directly.

From your DfE Sign-in dashboard, select the ‘manage users’ option. From here, you can invite a new user from the ‘related action’ list. Select the organisation the user needs to be added to from the list of organisations, then complete the 'invite user' form by entering their first name, last name and email address. 

You can only add users to organisations for which you are an approver. This could be an individual school, or, if you have approver status for a MAT or LA, you can either grant access to:

* individual schools contained within the organisation
* the whole organisation, allowing them to post jobs at any school

Once you have selected the organisation, choose Teaching Vacancies from the list of available services, as well as any others they need.

They will receive an email confirming that the service has been added to their account, allowing them to log in to Teaching Vacancies and begin posting jobs.

These steps will need to be repeated for each individual you need to add to the service.

## Responding to requests for access
Users with a DfE Sign-in account can request access to organisations and services. These requests are treated as separate steps: first, they need to be approved to join an organisation, and, second, they need to be approved to access a service. 

You will receive an email for each request that is made, and any active requests will be available to view on your DfE Sign-in dashboard.

## Managing users for your organisation
If you want to see who has access to your organisation, what services they can use, or make any changes to users, you can do so from within your DfE Sign-in account.

You can remove services from users within your organisation, or remove them from the organisation entirely. If you remove the user from a MAT or LA organisation, be aware that they may still have access to an individual organisation if they’ve been granted access separately.
