Teaching Vacancies uses the DfE Sign-in service to manage who is able to post vacancies for each school.

This allows organisation administrators to approve and manage users, granting them access to post and edit job adverts, and respond to candidate applications.

## Logging-in with your DfE Sign-in account

Access to Teaching Vacancies is managed through DfE Sign-in, which allows organisation administrators to manage various services provided by the Department for Education.

When you [sign into Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/publishers/sign-in), you will be redirected to the DfE Sign-in page. You can request a [DfE Sign-in account](https://profile.signin.education.gov.uk/register) if you do not already have one.

Your account will show which organisations your email address is associated with. This will either be none, one, or several. If you’re already associated with more than one organisation, you can choose which one you’d like to use to sign into Teaching Vacancies.
If you have access to an organisation but not Teaching Vacancies, you will need to [add the service to your account](#getting-access-to-the-teaching-vacancies-service).

## Getting access to organisations
### Managing vacancies for a single school

If you’re not yet associated with the school you’d like to manage vacancies for, you can ‘Request access to an organisation’ from your DfE Sign-in dashboard. Search for the school by name, URN, or UKPRN.

Once you find the school you’re looking for, confirm your request, adding an optional message to the approvers.

You can see the status of your request from your [Organisations](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/organisations) page. If you're waiting on approval and need to find out who is an approver for your school, contact the DSI support team and link to their support request.

### Managing vacancies for multiple schools

Managing vacancies from your dashboard allows you to get a glance at all your schools.
Alternatively, you can request access to a multi-academy trust (MAT) or local authority (LA), where you will be able to manage vacancies for multiple schools from a single dashboard.'

They are listed as organisations within DfE Sign-in and can be found in exactly the same way as individual schools by searching for the name of the trust, URN and UKPRN. If you’re approved for access to a MAT or LA, you will be able to post and manage job roles on Teaching Vacancies for all schools associated with that organisation.

Your request will be sent to the MAT or LA approver and you will receive an email confirmation once it has been granted.

You can see the status of your request on your [Organisations](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/organisations) page.

## Getting access to the Teaching Vacancies service

When you have been granted access to one or more organisations, go to your [My Services page](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/my-services) and select **'Request access to a service'**.

You’ll be asked which organisation you’re requesting a service for (if you have access to more than one) and can then select Teaching Vacancies from the list.

Your request will go back to the approver, and you will be able to see the status on your [My Services page](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/my-services).

## Being granted access by an approver

It’s possible for organisation administrators to grant users access to services directly, rather than requiring individuals to make a request.

If you are an approver at a school, MAT or LA, [find out how to give hiring staff access to Teaching Vacancies](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/get-help-hiring/how-to-approve-access-for-hiring-staff).

## Get help

If you’re still not getting a response, you can submit a support request through the [DfE Sign-In Help page](https://help.signin.education.gov.uk/contact-us). We are unable to assist with the approvals process through Teaching Vacancies.
