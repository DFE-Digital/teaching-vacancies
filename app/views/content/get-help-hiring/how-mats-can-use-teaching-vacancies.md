## Manage job listings across your multi-academy trust
Multi-academy trusts (MATs) can use Teaching Vacancies to manage applications for roles in schools across all of their locations, from the same place. This is called MAT-level access, [you can find out how to get access here](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/get-help-hiring/how-to-request-organisation-access). It's quick and simple to list jobs on Teaching Vacancies, whether you’re looking to fill roles in:

* a single school within a trust

* multiple schools within a trust

* any school across a trust (cross-trust roles)

* the MAT central office

You can view, edit, and copy all of your active, draft and closed job advertisements, no matter which school they’re for. With MAT-level access, you can view all of the schools in your trust within ‘Manage settings’. Here, you can change the description details of the MAT, as well as any school within the MAT, quickly and easily.





## Manage applications using the Teaching Vacancies application form
When posting a new job on our service, you’re given the option to use the Teaching Vacancies application form or an alternative application process. We recommend you choose to receive applications through Teaching Vacancies so you can:

* set up an application process for your job listing with one click, saving time
