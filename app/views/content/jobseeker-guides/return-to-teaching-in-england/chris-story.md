It was not until university, where I studied Design and Technology, that the idea of teaching occurred to me; as I really enjoyed the subject and had always enjoyed sharing and imparting knowledge to others, so I decided to give teaching a go.   

In 1993, I started teaching Design and Technology at Chiswick Community School in West London, having graduated with a degree and then a PGCE in Design and Technology with Subsidiary Maths. After six years, I moved to become the Head of Design and Technology at a challenging school in Croydon. It was a tough experience but also quite rewarding at times. 

From there, I landed a senior role at another school in Harrow in 2001 and was soon promoted to Assistant Headteacher in charge of Design and Technology with an overview of IT, amongst other responsibilities.  

I left classroom teaching in 2008 to help my wife run our after-school tuition centre where I tutored Maths for children aged 6–16 years. I really fancied being my own boss, in charge of my own time and was excited to build a family business.   

Fast forward to 2024, having co-run our business for 16 years, my wife is ready to retire. It can be challenging working for yourself and I didn’t want to continue running the business on my own without her, nor did I feel ready to retire from teaching either, as I love it too much.  

## Getting back into the classroom

Although working in teaching the way that I had done for the past 16 years had its benefits, there was undoubtedly quite a bit that I missed about teaching in schools, such as working with a wide variety of colleagues and learners.   

One of the most rewarding things about teaching is that ‘penny drop’ moment you get every now and again when a child really understands something that they’ve struggled with. It is when you know you’ve really made a difference. I love watching pupils grow in confidence and self-belief.   

All these factors combined led me to return to the school classroom. Given that my most recent teaching experience was in Maths, which I have really enjoyed, and that there’s no doubt been quite a few technological advancements in Design and Technology, I opted to return as a Maths teacher. Although I would still welcome teaching some Design and Technology in future.  

I was so grateful for the support from a return to teaching adviser. I have not been to a competitive interview for a long time! 

> “From the personal statement to the interview, the return to teaching adviser guided me through the whole application process every step of the way.”

It was like having a mentor and I did everything that was suggested to refresh my knowledge and skills. There is no doubt in my mind that I wouldn’t have secured a role as quickly without her invaluable help, and I am really indebted to her for all of that.  

I am anticipating that my return will be a steep learning curve as a lot will have changed. For example, when I left the profession, the interactive whiteboard was just coming in. Now I will be expected to use this tech (and more!) which I haven’t ever touched before; but I am confident I’ll be able to pick it up quickly.
