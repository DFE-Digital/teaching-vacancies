The [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards?) are a framework for professional conduct and teaching quality. When you apply for a teaching role, you may be assessed to see how well you meet them.  
 
You can use the framework as a checklist and gather examples to show how you meet each one. 
 
## Set high expectations which inspire, motivate and challenge pupils 

Can you provide an example of when you set high expectations that inspired, motivated and challenged pupils – what was the result? 
  
## Promote good progress and outcomes by pupils  

Can you provide an example of how you have been responsible for student progress? 

Can you share a time when you adapted your teaching to meet different needs? 
  
## Demonstrate good subject knowledge 

How can you demonstrate your subject and curriculum knowledge? 

Have you got any recent examples of CPD or training?  
  
## Plan and teach well structured lessons 

Can you show how you have supported pupils to learn by structuring lessons effectively? 
  
## Make accurate and productive use of assessment 

Can you provide examples of how you’ve used assessments to assess pupil progress and adapt your teaching – what feedback did you give to improve their outcomes? 
  
## Manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment   

Can you give examples of how you’ve created a positive and safe environment for pupils? 
  
## Fulfil wider professional responsibilities 

Can you show how you have communicated and collaborated effectively with colleagues and parents? 
 
## Get support from a return to teaching advisor
 
If you have previously taught or trained to teach in the UK, you could be eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers?). 
 
Advisers offer free one-to-one support to help prepare you for a teaching interview. They can also provide you with advice about CPD and training opportunities. 
 
You can chat by phone, text or email, as little or as often as you need.
