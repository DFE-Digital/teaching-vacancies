> While I originally set out to become a journalist when I chose to study English at university, my love for the English subject, reading, and literature drew me towards pursuing a career in teaching.   
>
> My route into the profession started with an administrative role as a headteacher’s PA at a school in Kent and this was a stepping stone to the role I wanted: teaching English. I didn’t want an office-based job—I wanted a role that was varied, and I found this in the classroom.  
>
> I trained as an English classroom teacher in an all-boys comprehensive school and quickly progressed to become Second in the English department. After 6 years, I became Head of Department at an all-girls grammar school. I was there for three years before joining a comprehensive mixed high school as a Head of Department. This role developed into Head of Faculty, overseeing additional subjects such as modern and foreign languages, arts, drama, and performing arts. I really enjoyed having more responsibility and ownership of other areas.  
> 
> When I went on maternity leave to have my daughter in 2014, I envisioned putting my career on hold, not departing from the profession entirely. I had anticipated that I would return part-time as a classroom teacher, but then other factors came into play. Because of my love for teaching, I had invested myself quite heavily in previous roles and I didn’t want to compromise my job for my children or my children for my job. Hence, I opted to have a complete break. I took a full year of maternity leave and ultimately stepped away from the classroom after that, culminating in an 8 year break from teaching – and during this time I had my second child. 
>
> I always knew I would return to the classroom; I never lost my passion for teaching.
>
> I have been marking for exam boards since my very early days of teaching and carried on some exam marking during my career break from the classroom. This was a great way of maintaining subject knowledge. I was also involved with my kids’ pre-school committees when they were younger, and I’m a governor at my children’s school which I started during maternity leave.  
>
> As a mother, although it can be a juggle, I also think a teaching career can complement family life quite well. To be able to spend the school holidays with the kids is priceless.  
>
## Getting back into the classroom

> I started looking for a teaching job when my second child started reception, as the plan was for me to return to work when both kids were at school. I had expected to go back to the classroom as a supply teacher, but I secured a job as a part-time English classroom teacher working two days a week, which was perfect to help ease myself back into teaching.  
>
> When I returned to the classroom, it wasn’t the teaching itself that I found challenging. It was having to manage my job differently around the kids. Previously I only had to worry about getting myself up and into work and I had committed myself more than necessary. Now, I need to think about my children first. That is probably the most challenging part of returning to teaching. It means I am a lot more conscious of my time management. I have always been organised with my time, but you have to really think about that, and you have to be a lot more realistic about what you can and can’t do.  
>
> I am now Second in Charge of English in my current role and my time has now built up to four days a week. A pupil recently came up to me and thanked me for a nice comment I had written when marking his exam paper. I had said he had a lovely fluent writing style. It was a passing comment but it’s in these moments when you realise you’re making a little bit of difference. 
>
> My advice to former teachers who are thinking about returning to the classroom is to get back into a school if they are not sure. The thought of returning can be daunting but once you get back into it, you’ll know how you really feel about coming back to the classroom. 
>
> The beauty of teaching is that it is a career that you can pick up again after a break. Schools will always be looking for great teachers.
