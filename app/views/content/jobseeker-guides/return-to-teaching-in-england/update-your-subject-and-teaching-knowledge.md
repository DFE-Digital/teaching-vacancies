If you’re returning to teaching, refreshing your subject and teaching knowledge will improve your confidence and prepare you for your return to the classroom.

You might find it helpful to:

* complete a subject knowledge audit to identify any weak spots in your knowledge 
* read [current behaviour management guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-in-schools--2)
* look at [early career teacher resources](https://support-for-early-career-teachers.education.gov.uk/)
* read the [Keeping children safe in education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2) statutory safeguarding guidance for schools
* find out what improvements have been made to [national professional qualifications (NPQs)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-professional-qualification-npq-courses?)  – you may also be eligible for scholarship funding
* update your knowledge by engaging with subject organisations – if you have previously taught or trained to teach in the UK, a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers?) can recommend which ones you should consider contacting

## Prepare to return to teaching

If you are thinking about returning to primary teaching, you should read the [key stage 1 and 2 national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-primary-curriculum?). If you are thinking about returning to secondary teaching, you should read the [key stage 3 and 4 national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-secondary-curriculum?).

You may also want to:

* research the current teaching methods and practices
* consider taking a refresher course

## Get a return to teaching adviser

If you have previously taught or trained to teach in the UK, you could be eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers?).

Advisers can give you free one-to-one support with accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge or teaching practice.

You can chat by phone, text or email, as little or as often as you need.
