If you’re returning to teaching, refreshing your subject and teaching knowledge will improve your confidence and prepare you for your return to the classroom.

Consider what is important to update yourself on and how you can bring yourself up to date at a pace that suits you.

You might find it helpful to:

* complete a subject knowledge audit to identify any weak spots in your knowledge 
* read [current behaviour management guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/behaviour-in-schools--2)
* read the [Keeping children safe in education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2) statutory safeguarding guidance for schools
* find out what improvements have been made to [national professional qualifications (NPQs)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-professional-qualification-npq-courses?)  – you may also be eligible for scholarship funding
* update your knowledge by engaging with subject organisations – if you have previously taught or trained to teach in the UK, a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers?) can recommend which ones you should consider contacting

## Prepare to return to primary teaching
If you are thinking about returning to primary teaching, you should:

* read the key stage (KS) 1 and 2 [national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-primary-curriculum?).
* research the current teaching methods and practices for KS1 and KS2
* consider taking a refresher course 

## Prepare to return to secondary teaching
If you are thinking about returning to secondary teaching, you should:

* read the KS3 and KS4 [national curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-secondary-curriculum?)

* consider taking a refresher course

## Get a return to teaching adviser

If you have previously taught or trained to teach in the UK, you could be eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers?).

Advisers can give you free one-to-one support with accessing courses to enhance your subject knowledge or teaching practice.
