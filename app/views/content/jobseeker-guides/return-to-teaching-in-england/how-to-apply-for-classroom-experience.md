When you contact a school to arrange classroom experience, you should include a short cover letter and CV. 

Where possible, you should contact the school by email, which can usually be found on the school’s website.

## What to include in your CV 
 
Your CV should be no longer than 2 pages and include: 

* your contact details and Teacher Reference Number (TRN), if you have one  
* correct spelling, punctuation and grammar  
* your job history and qualifications in reverse chronological order, with your most recent job or qualification first 
* the details and responsibilities from your previous roles 
* specific details about your qualifications   
* any other relevant experience you may have  
* the job title and contact details for your referees

## Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks 
 
[DBS checks](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-checking-service-guidance--2?) (formerly CRB checks) are records of a person’s criminal convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings. 
  
Some schools may ask you to complete a DBS check before they let you to join the classroom for experience. If you have a recent DBS certificate, let the school know as they may accept it.  
 
Some schools may allow an initial visit without a DBS, provided you’re: 

* always supervised by a staff member 
* not left alone with pupils 

You may not be allowed on school grounds without proper identification (ID). You must check with the school beforehand to see what forms of ID are required.
