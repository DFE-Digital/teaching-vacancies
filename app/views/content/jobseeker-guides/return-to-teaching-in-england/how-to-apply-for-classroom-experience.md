When you find a school you'd like to arrange classroom experience with, you should contact them by email (the school's email address can usually be found on their website). 

Send them a short cover note to tell them you're a returning teacher looking for classroom experience, along with your CV.

In your cover note, you may want to include:

* the key stages you have previously taught and, if applying for secondary, the main subjects you can teach
* when you last taught
* the ideal length of time you would like the experience to last
* anything unique or specific from your previous experience that you think may showcase your skills

If the school you have contacted is unable to provide you with classroom experience, you may want to ask if there are opportunities in other schools in their trust or area that they are aware of, or request that they keep you in mind for future opportunities.

## What to include in your CV 
 
Typically CVs are no longer than 2 pages and include: 

* your contact details and Teacher Reference Number (TRN), if you have one  
* your job history and qualifications in reverse chronological order, with your most recent job or qualification first 
* the details and responsibilities from your previous roles 
* specific details about your qualifications   
* any other relevant experience you may have

## Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks 
 
[DBS checks](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/dbs-checking-service-guidance--2?) (formerly CRB checks) are records of a person’s criminal convictions, cautions, reprimands and warnings. 
  
Some schools may ask you to complete a DBS check before they let you join the classroom for experience. If you have a recent DBS certificate, let the school know as they may accept it.  
 
Some schools may allow an initial visit without a DBS, provided you’re: 

* always supervised by a staff member 
* not left alone with pupils 

You may not be allowed on school grounds without proper identification (ID). You must check with the school beforehand to see what forms of ID are required.   
  
Part 3 of [Keeping children safe in education guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2) explains what type of DBS check is required and when.
