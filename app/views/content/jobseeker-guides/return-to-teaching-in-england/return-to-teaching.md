Returning to teaching might be easier than you think.

Time away and different life experiences can help give you a fresh perspective on being a teacher.

Schools are interested in recruiting former teachers like you so you can continue your teaching career with them.

A return to teaching provides you with an opportunity to take greater control of your career to shape a role that suits your skills, ambition and situation.

Flexible working options can also help you start back in a way that works for you.
