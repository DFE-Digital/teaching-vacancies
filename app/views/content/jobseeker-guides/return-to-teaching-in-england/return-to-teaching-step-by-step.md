Check what you need to do to return to teach in a state-funded school in England. If you need support returning to teaching after a break, you could be eligible for a [return to teaching adviser](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/landing/return-to-teaching-advisers). You can find additional support on [Get support returning to teaching](/jobseeker-guides/return-to-teaching-in-england/return-to-teaching/).
