My journey into education was influenced by my parents’ career choices – they were both teachers and I felt drawn to the idea of having my own class one day and making a meaningful impact on children’s lives. Even though I gained a master’s degree in civil engineering, I decided to go into the Teach First graduate scheme fresh out of university. 

It was a difficult start. My first ever lesson was a baptism of fire. After 6 weeks of intensive training, I started teaching as a mathematics teacher at a challenging secondary inner city London school. I was on my own in the classroom from 8.30am–3.30pm and had to learn very quickly on the job.  

After qualifying and 2 tough years, I felt burnt out. I decided to go travelling and pursue a career in my degree field. When I left the classroom, I didn’t consciously give up teaching, but I left not knowing if I would return.  

After spending time in South America and Madagascar, I came home and landed a job as an energy engineer. My role was focused on behaviour change which reflected my skills in people management but in stark contrast to teaching, I felt it lacked purpose and did not offer the same rewards.  

After 1 year in the job, I decided to return to the classroom. I missed the quick pace and the fulfilment of teaching.  

## Getting back into the classroom

The pedagogy and educational landscape were much the same as when I left the classroom but there is always trepidation. Success and happiness in teaching is dependent on the school environment being a good fit. I was determined to find a school that would be a good match for me and was fortunate to find a teaching position in just one week.  

In 2014 I joined Lea Valley High School and quickly became Lead Practitioner of Mathematics. In 2016, I became Deputy Head of Maths at a new school, Ark John Keats Academy. Fast forward 8 years and I am now Assistant Principal and Head of Sixth Form at the same school, and I’ve never looked back.  

I love teaching despite its challenges as I never have a wasted day. Even a tough day is a rewarding day when you teach.

Some of the children at Ark John Keats Academy have endured a lot of hardship and to see the difference you can make to their lives is hugely gratifying. Over 60% of my students last year went to the UK’s top third universities and we received our very first two offers of university places at Cambridge.  

Returning to teaching has been life-changing – a positive decision for both me and my pupils.
