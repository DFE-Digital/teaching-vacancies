Schools will expect you to reflect on your recent school experience when you apply for a teaching role.

If you're returning to teaching after a break, you should check the experience requirements of specific schools before you apply for a role.

To get more school experience, you should:

* observe lessons in subjects that you wish to teach
* see a variety of teaching styles, with students of different abilities and backgrounds

## Contact a school

The [Get information About Schools site](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/?) has a list of all the educational establishments in England and Wales. You can filter your search by education phase and location to find a suitable school.

You may need to contact several schools in your area to arrange school experience

## Find experience using a subject organisation

Subject organisations can help you find classroom experience in a specific subject.

### Maths Hubs

## Find a job at a local school

You could consider applying for other roles at a local school to gain classroom experience.

### Teaching assistant (TA)

TAs help teachers in primary or secondary schools, working one-on-one or with small groups of pupils. 

TAs mainly support pupils in the classroom but may also take them to a nearby room or area for activities such as reading sessions or booster support for struggling students.
