Schools will expect you to reflect on your recent school experience when you apply for a teaching role.

If you're returning to teaching after a break, you should check the experience requirements of specific schools before you apply for a role.

To get more school experience, you should:

* observe lessons in subjects that you wish to teach
* see a variety of teaching styles, with students of different abilities and backgrounds

## Contact a school

The [Get Information about Schools site](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/?) has a list of all the educational establishments in England and Wales. You can find suitable schools to contact by filtering your search by education phase and location.

You may need to contact several schools in your area before finding one that can offer classroom experience.

## Find experience using a subject organisation

Subject organisations can help you find classroom experience in a specific subject.

### Maths Hubs

[Maths Hubs](https://www.ncetm.org.uk/maths-hubs/?) is a program that connects mathematics professionals through a network of 40 hubs across the country. Each hub is led by an outstanding local school or college.

### Institute of Physics

[Institute of Physics](https://www.iop.org/) is a support network for teachers and pupils of physics.

### STEM Ambassadors

[STEM Ambassadors](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors) inspire young people to enjoy science, technology, engineering and maths.

## Find a job at a local school

You could consider applying for other roles at a local school to gain classroom experience.

### Teaching assistant (TA)

TAs help teachers in primary or secondary schools, working one-on-one or with small groups of pupils. 

TAs mainly support pupils in the classroom but may also take them to a nearby room or area for activities such as reading sessions or booster support for struggling students.
