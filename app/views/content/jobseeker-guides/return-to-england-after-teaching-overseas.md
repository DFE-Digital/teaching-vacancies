Get support if you’re a UK citizen thinking about returning from overseas to teach in England. 
The skills, experience and perspective you’ve gained outside the UK are highly valued by schools and headteachers.

If you’re a non-UK citizen, read our [guidance for international trainees and teachers.](https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/non-uk-teachers)

## Check your qualifications
Before you start looking for teaching jobs, check which qualifications you need to teach in England.

[Qualified teacher status (QTS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/qualified-teacher-status-qts) is a legal requirement to teach in many English schools. 
Even where QTS is not a legal requirement, many schools use it to assess the quality of candidates.

### If you trained in the UK
If you completed your teacher training in England, you should already have QTS. 
You can check this with the [Teaching Regulation Agency.](https://teacherservices.education.gov.uk/SelfService/Login)

### If you do not have QTS
If you trained as a teacher or have gained teaching experience outside the UK, you can [learn more about the best route to QTS for your circumstances.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-qualified-teacher-status-qts-if-you-teach-outside-the-uk/routes-to-qualified-teacher-status-qts-for-teachers-and-those-with-teaching-experience-outside-the-uk)
