Teaching Vacancies is the official government service to help you find your perfect teaching role. 

Nearly 90% of schools advertise roles on Teaching Vacancies with new jobs added almost daily. 

## Get jobs sent to you 

Let the right job find you by signing up for daily or weekly job alerts and get an email when a new role is available. 

Easily focus your search by distance, subject and what kind of job you’re looking for, such as your first teaching role, or a part-time job. 

## Set up a profile 

You can share your information with local schools you're interested in teaching at.  

Schools can then reach out to you if they think you’re a good fit for their role. 

## Apply quickly for roles 

Use our online application form to quickly apply for jobs.

We'll save your details so you won’t have to spend time filling in new applications every time, where quick apply is available.
