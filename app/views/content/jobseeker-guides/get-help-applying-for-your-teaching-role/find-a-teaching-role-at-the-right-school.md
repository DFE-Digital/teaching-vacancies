When searching for your perfect teaching role you'll need to think about the location, size and setting of the school you'd like to work in. 
Teaching Vacancies is here to make it easier to work out what you’re looking for. 
You can find out more about schools you’re interested in on the [Get Information about Schools service.](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/)

The time you spend teaching is only one aspect of life in a school. 
The wider school culture and community will have a big impact on your experience. 
All schools have a different approach to culture, curriculum, values, and wellbeing. 
The school’s approach to these will help you enjoy your working life.

Feel free to ask hiring staff any questions before applying for a job. 
You can also organise a school visit to get a feel for what the school is like.

## School culture
The best way to get a sense of what a school is like is to experience it in person, and you should feel comfortable to make an appointment for a school visit. 
You could also have a look at the school's website or newsletter. 
Some schools might share their news and successes on social media too.

## Curriculum
You should be able to find the school’s curriculum on their website. 
Specifically for secondary roles, think about how you could demonstrate your subject knowledge in your application.

## School vision and mission statement
Checking the school’s vision, values and mission statement is a great way to find out what the school is like.

## Staff wellbeing
Have a look at the job description or school website to see how the school supports its staff.

Pastoral support is key for happiness in the workplace. 
Have a look at the [Education staff wellbeing charter](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/education-staff-wellbeing-charter) and find out if the school you are interested in has signed up. 
The charter is a shared commitment to protect, promote and enhance the wellbeing of school staff. 
Schools will approach wellbeing differently, so even if they aren’t signed up to the charter, it’s a good idea to ask how staff are supported.
