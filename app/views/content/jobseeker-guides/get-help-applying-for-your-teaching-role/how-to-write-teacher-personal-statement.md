Your personal statement is your first opportunity to show the school you’re a great fit for the job, so it's important you get the basics right.

Here are some top tips for writing your teacher personal statement:

* write in your own voice
* show how your experience meets the job description
* tailor it to the school with specific examples
* share your knowledge of teaching theory and research
* show your skills, qualities and how you would contribute to wider school life


## Write in your own voice
It can be tricky to know where to start with your personal statement.

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help you generate ideas and structure your writing, but it's important not to rely on them too heavily. Schools want to see your skills, experience and personality in your own words.

If you need help getting started, you can use our purpose-built personal statement builder.

## Using the personal statement builder
The personal statement builder provides writing prompts and guidance based on the job description of the role you’re applying for, and the information you provide about yourself.

It also features short videos from school leaders, with advice from them on what makes a successful teaching personal statement.

## What to include in your personal statement
There’s no set length for a teacher personal statement, but many schools expect them to be around 1 to 2 pages. Focus on being clear and concise. 

Use your introductory paragraph to outline the reasons why you are a good fit for the school.

You can tailor your personal statement using information from the school’s website, such as their ethos and values. 

You may want to include examples that show you meet the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards?). Try to make your examples detailed and concise. 

## Show how you meet the job description
Share examples that show how you meet the criteria in the job description. 

Focus on meeting the essential criteria but include examples for the desirable criteria, if you’re able to. 

Explain each example clearly and highlight its impact on pupil outcomes. 

If you're a returning teacher, you can share how your time away from the classroom has also added to your skills and experience. [Find out more about returning to teaching](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/jobseeker-guides/return-to-teaching-in-england).

### Write specific examples
These 2 examples show the difference between a strong example and one that needs improvement.

#### Example 1
"I have always wanted to be a teacher. I enjoy working with children and I think I would be good at this role."

This example is very general, not tailored to the school and does not give hiring staff a clear picture of skills, experience or any outcomes achieved.

#### Example 2 
"I am keen to apply for teaching role at [School name here], where the emphasis on high expectations and inclusive practice reflects my own values."

In my current role, I introduced a behaviour strategy that reduced low level disruption and improved pupil engagement, showing my commitment to the teachers' standards on managing behaviour and promoting good progress".

This example is much better – it's tailored to the school and includes a specific example from practice. It shows what the applicant did, and how it links to the teachers' standards.

Including this level of detail helps hiring staff understand your experience more clearly and is more likely to stand out.

## What experience do you have?
Schools want to hear about your experience with different subjects, key stages, types of school, and working with a range of pupils.

Think about your approach to teaching, how you keep pupils engaged, and how you communicate with different kinds of people (children, staff, parents and carers).

Ensure you provide evidence for how you have improved engagement and built positive relationships with pupils.

Schools will be interested in your approach to behaviour management, so think about your go-to strategies.

## Are you engaged in teaching theory and research?
Think about any research that has affected your teaching practice. Explain what has worked well and if it didn’t, what you learnt.

You could mention how a piece of training, reading or classroom research shaped your approach, and highlight the impact it had. 

This shows schools that you:

* are reflective and committed to continuous improvement
*	can demonstrate professional awareness of current educational thinking 
*	show evidence that you can adapt and refine your practice to meet pupils’ needs

## What are your skills and qualities?
Schools are looking for great communicators, team players and relationship builders. Make sure you say how you create a positive learning environment, and consider skills like time management, organisation, and flexibility.

Schools will also want to know how you overcome challenges.

### How can you contribute to wider school life?
Set yourself apart by showing how your hobbies and achievements could contribute to the wider school community.

You could include:

* sports and fitness – coaching a football team, starting a new club, or leading a morning fitness session
*	creative arts – supporting the school choir, directing a play or running an arts workshop
*	science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities – starting a coding club, organising a science fair or robotics competition
*	pastoral support – mentoring pupils, helping with assemblies, or supporting wellbeing initiatives 
*	community engagement – coordinating charity events, cultural celebrations or workshops with parents
