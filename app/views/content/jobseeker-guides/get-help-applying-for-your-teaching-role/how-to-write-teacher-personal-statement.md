Your personal statement is your first opportunity to show the school you’re a great fit for the job, and gets you closer to being shortlisted for an interview. The more you show how your skills and interests match the school’s ethos and values, the better. We've spoken to a range of teachers to get their top tips for success.


## What experience do you have?
Schools want to hear about your trainee experience with different subjects, key stages, types of school, and working with a range of pupils.

Think about your approach to teaching, how you keep pupils engaged, and how you communicate with different kinds of people (children, staff, parents and carers). Ensure you provide evidence for how you have improved student engagement and built positive relationships with pupils.

Schools will be interested in your approach to behaviour management, so think about your go-to strategies.

## Are you engaged in teaching theory and research?
Think about any research that has affected your teaching practice. Explain what has worked well and if it didn’t, what you learnt.


## Are you up to date on safeguarding statutory guidance?
You need to demonstrate your awareness of the importance of safeguarding and the requirements of [Keeping Children Safe in Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2). Include any examples of how you worked with a Designated Safeguarding Lead.


## What are your skills and qualities?
Are you a well-organised, confident, and motivated teacher? Say it, and provide examples! Schools are looking for great communicators, team players and relationship builders. Make sure you say how you create a positive learning environment, and consider skills like time management, organisation, and flexibility.
Schools will also want to know how you overcome challenges.

## How can you contribute to wider school life?
Set yourself apart by showing how your hobbies and achievements could contribute to the wider school community. Could you run an after school club or organise school trips?
