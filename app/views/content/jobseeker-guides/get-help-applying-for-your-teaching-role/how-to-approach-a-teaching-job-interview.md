Congratulations, you’ve been invited to an interview for a teaching job! What’s next? We’ve spoken to experienced teachers to get their top tips for success including how to prepare answers to interview questions.

## 1. Confirm your attendance
Make sure you accept the interview by email and reiterate your enthusiasm for the role. Make a note of any key staff names, who to ask for on your arrival, and what resources to bring with you.

## 2. Prepare any documentation
The school may require you to bring evidence of your:

* identity, such as your passport or driving license
* residency of working rights
* exam qualifications, such as exam certificates or transcripts - if you do not have these to hand, you can [access your teaching qualifications](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/access-your-teaching-qualifications) if you obtained these in England

These will be used for standard safeguarding checks.

## 3. Think about your journey and appearance
Plan how you will get to the interview in advance. Do you know the best train to catch, or where the car park is? Think about your appearance too; be you and be comfortable but consider professional clothing to create a positive first impression. 

## 4. Prepare answers to common interview questions
Interview styles vary across schools – some may be formal while others may be more conversational. Study the school's website to get a sense of what the school is like. 

Prepare answers to likely questions and try to do a mock interview with a friend or colleague. Saying your answers out loud is really different to practising in your head. 

You can never predict all of the questions, but schools might ask:

* why do you want to work in our school?
* what are your strongest qualities and why? 
* what areas do you need to improve on? (Think professionally, not a personality trait)
* how do you adapt your teaching to ensure all pupils make progress?
* what would you do if a child told you something that concerned you?
* tell us about a recent lesson and why it went well

You may be assessed against the [teachers’ standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/teachers-standards) so you might want to prepare clear, strong examples to show how you have met each standard. 

Take your time answering a question and ask for clarification if needed. 

## 5. Prepare for a teaching interview lesson
You’ll likely be asked to teach a lesson as part of your interview. 

Read advice from experienced school leaders on how to best [prepare for a teaching interview lesson](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/jobseeker-guides/get-help-applying-for-your-teaching-role/prepare-for-a-teaching-job-interview-lesson).

## 6. Know about statutory guidance on safeguarding
If you have not had any experience of dealing with a safeguarding issue yourself, you must still be able to talk about what you would do. Think of some possible scenarios and explain how you would address them.

[Statutory guidance for schools and colleges on safeguarding children and safer recruitment on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/keeping-children-safe-in-education--2).

## 7. Ask the panel questions
This shows your interest and gives you the opportunity to inform your decision about the role. You could ask:

* what do you like about your school?
* what are their priorities for the School Improvement Plan (SIP)? How far have they been achieved? What are the biggest challenges?
* what support is there for teachers?

## 8. After your interview
If you are not offered the role: 

* read through any feedback you receive from the hiring manager - this can help you succeed in your next interview 
* ask the hiring manager for feedback if they do not offer to provide it 
* remember that securing an interview shows you are a strong candidate – you are likely to be shortlisted again 

If you are offered the role:  

* take time to consider if the role is the right fit for you before accepting it – verbally accepting an offer is legally binding, so changing your mind later may breach contract terms 
* confirm your decision in writing if you decide to accept 
* expect to receive a written contract within 2 months of starting your new role – this should be signed by both parties as a formality
