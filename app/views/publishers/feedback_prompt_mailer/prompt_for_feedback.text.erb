# <%= t('app.title') %>

Dear vacancy publisher,

We’re constantly working to improve <%= t('app.title') %>. You can help us do so by answering a couple of quick questions about the following expired job listings for your school:

<%- @vacancies.each do |vacancy| %>
  <%="* #{vacancy.job_title}" %>
<% end %>

It should only take a minute or 2 of your time. Just <%= notify_link(new_publisher_session_url, "sign into your Teaching Vacancies account") %> and select the ‘Jobs awaiting feedback’ tab.

If you are already signed in to your Teaching Vacancies account you can access the expired jobs awaiting your feedback by clicking <%= notify_link(jobs_with_type_organisation_url(type: 'awaiting_feedback') , "here") %>.

Insights from schools like yours are essential to our efforts to improve Teaching Vacancies. With your help we can make it the resource schools prefer to use when looking for teachers, leading to even bigger savings on recruitment costs.

So thanks for your feedback!

Kind regards,

The <%= t('app.title') %> team
