      ### Using the Service
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      By accessing and using the Teaching Vacancies website (the 'Service') you, as the user, are confirming that you accept
      these terms and conditions ('General Terms'). This takes effect from the date you first use the Service. If you do not
      agree to these General Terms, you must not use this website.

      If we change these General Terms we will post the revised document here with an updated effective date. If we make
      significant changes to these terms, we may notify you by other means such as sending an email or posting a notice on
      our home page.

      By using Teaching Vacancies you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions.

      ### **Information about us**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      This Service is operated by [the Department for
      Education](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-education) ('we', 'our',
      or 'us'). We are a central government department and have our registered office at Sanctuary Buildings, 20 Great
      Smith Street, SW1P 3BT.

      You can contact us using the following email address: [teaching.vacancies@education.gov.uk](mailto:teaching.vacancies@education.gov.uk)

      ### **Hyperlinking to the Teaching Vacancies website**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      We do not object to you linking directly to pages on this site and you do not need to ask permission to do so.
      However, we do not permit our pages to be loaded into frames on your site.

      The Teaching Vacancies pages must be displayed in the user's entire browser window.

      You may not charge your website's users to click on a link to any page on the Service.

      ### **Third-party content and hyperlinking from the Service**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      We are not liable or responsible for the third-party content on the Service. Third-party content includes
      material posted by other users of the Service, job listings, uploaded documents and their contents, and
      display advertising.

      Where the Service contains links to other sites and resources, we are not liable or responsible for the content or
      reliability of those websites and resources. We do not necessarily endorse the views expressed within them.

      We aim to replace broken links to other sites but cannot guarantee that these links will always work as we have no
      control over the availability of other sites.

      ### **Virus protection**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      We make every effort to check and test material at all stages of production. It is always wise for you to run an
      antivirus program on all material downloaded from the Internet as we do not guarantee our service will be secure or
      free from bugs or viruses. We cannot accept any responsibility for any loss, disruption or damage to your data or
      your computer system which may occur whilst using material from this website.

      You must not misuse our service by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material that
      is malicious or technologically harmful.

      You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to our service, the server on which our service is stored or any
      server, computer or database connected to our service.

      You must not attack our site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack.

      Each of these acts is a criminal offence. We will report any such offence to the relevant law enforcement
      authorities and co-operate with them to determine your identity. In the event of such a breach your right to use the
      Service will cease immediately.

      ### **Disclaimer and Liability**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      The content of this Service includes both content created by us (included but not limited to content that helps you
      use the Service) and third-party content (included but not limited to job listings). We do not:

      * endorse third-party content
      * vouch for its accuracy
      * guarantee that the views, instructions and/or assertions expressed in it are our own
      {: .govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet }

      The content we create for the Service is not advice. You should verify any information on the Service yourself and
      use your own judgement before doing or not doing anything on the basis of the content.

      Unless expressly stated in writing by us, the Service and material relating to government information, products and
      services (or to third-party information, products and services), is provided 'as is', without any representation
      or endorsement made and without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the
      implied warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, compatibility,
      security and accuracy.

      We do not warrant that the functions contained in the material contained in this site will be uninterrupted or error
      free, that defects will be corrected, or that this site or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or
      represent the full functionality, accuracy, reliability of the materials.

      In no event will we be liable for:

      * any action you may take as a result of relying on any information/materials provided on the Service or for any
      loss or damage suffered by you as a result of you taking such action including, without limitation, indirect or
      consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the use of
      the Service
      * any dealings you have with third parties (other users or advertisers, for example) that take place using or
      facilitated by the Service
      {: .govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet }

      ### **Validity of these General Terms**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      If any of these terms and conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining
      terms and conditions will still apply.

      ### **Applicable law and jurisdiction**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      These General Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any dispute arising under these General Terms
      will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

      ## **Terms and conditions for schools, trusts and local authorities (LAs)**
      {: .govuk-heading-l}

      ### **Approving user accounts**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      Users must be approved before they are given a Teaching Vacancies account for the purposes of publishing or
      managing job listings for a school or trust. Each school, trust or LA must have a nominated 'approver' who is
      responsible for approving Teaching Vacancies accounts for users at that school, trust or LA.

      An approver must only allow someone working for their school, trust or LA to publish or manage job listings for
      their school or trust.

      Approvers must not create accounts for or allow third parties to publish or manage job listings on behalf of their
      school, trust or LA. If the Teaching Vacancies team detects or is alerted to any account held by or used by third
      parties then that account will be deleted immediately.

      ### **Using the Service**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      By accessing and using the Service you, as the user, are confirming that you accept these General Terms. This
      takes effect from the date you first use the Service. If you do not agree to these General Terms, you must not use
      this website.

      By using Teaching Vacancies you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions.

      ### **Unacceptable use**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      You must not publish, edit or delete a job listing if you do not have authority from the school, trust or local authority to do so.

      Local authorities, multi-academy trusts and other organisations must not charge any fee or commission for listing a job on Teaching Vacancies.

      You must not publish:

      * listings for teaching vacancies that aren't relevant to the service, such as but not limited to non-teaching
      roles, supply teaching roles and unpaid positions
      * listings for unconfirmed or non-existent vacancies
      * listings for any school or trust that is not state funded, that is not in England or that does not teach primary
      or secondary pupils
      * offensive or inappropriate language, including but not limited to profanities or language pejorative of any
      group, such as racist, sexist or homophobic comments
      * discriminatory content: you must not state or imply in a job advert that you will discriminate against anyone
      (subject to certain exceptions under the Equality Act 2010, particularly those applying to schools with a
      religious character); for further information see GOV.UK's [guidance on discrimination in job
      adverts](https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination/recruitment)
      * material that infringes any intellectual property rights, such as copyright and trademarks (this means generally
      that you must own the rights in everything you submit or must obtain permission from the rights owner to submit
      the material)
      * material that is technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan
      horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software or harmful data)
      * material that encourages or teaches conduct that is a criminal offence, gives rise to civil liability, or is
      otherwise unlawful
      {: .govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet }

      ### **Access to the Service**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      We will not be liable if for any reason the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
      time, we may restrict access to all or some parts of the Service to users who have registered with us.

      If you choose, or are provided with, a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as
      part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to
      any third party.

      We reserve the right to restrict or deny you access to all or some parts of the Service if, in our opinion, you
      have failed to comply with these terms and conditions.

      The Department for Education retains the right to withdraw without notice listings that breach these terms and to
      withdraw the access of users who breach them.

      ### **Listing data**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      Application Programming Interface (API) use: listings are published under the [Open Government
      Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/)
      (OGL), which permits a wide range of information in the public sector to be reused free of charge. This means the
      listing data on Teaching Vacancies will be available to third parties to publish on external sites after the pilot
      phase, aside from where [exceptions to the
      OGL](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/exceptions-to-ogl/)
      prohibit it.

      Data ownership: schools have sole responsibility for maintaining the accuracy and appropriateness of the data
      contained in their listings.

      ### **Terms and conditions for API users**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      You are free to reuse job listing data under the terms of the [Open Government
      Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) for public sector
      information with the following exception:

      * you may not charge a school any fee or commission for contacting, interviewing or hiring a respondent to your
      advertisement or listing if it is based on Teaching Vacancies data that you have reused.
