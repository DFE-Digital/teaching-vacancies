      Unless expressly stated in writing by us, the Service and material relating to government information, products and
      services (or to third-party information, products and services), is provided 'as is', without any representation
      or endorsement made and without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to the

      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      If any of these terms and conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining
      terms and conditions will still apply.

      ### **Applicable law and jurisdiction**

      {: .govuk-heading-l}

      ### **Approving user accounts**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      Users must be approved before they are given a Teaching Vacancies account for the purposes of publishing or
      managing job listings for a school or trust. Each school, trust or LA must have a nominated 'approver' who is
      responsible for approving Teaching Vacancies accounts for users at that school, trust or LA. An approver must only
      allow someone working for their school, trust or LA to publish or manage job listings for their school or trust.
      Approvers must not create accounts for or allow third parties to publish or manage job listings on behalf of their
      school, trust or LA. If the Teaching Vacancies team detects or is alerted to any account held by or used by third
      parties then that account will be deleted immediately.

      * listings for teaching vacancies that aren't relevant to the service, such as but not limited to non-teaching
      roles, supply teaching roles and unpaid positions
      * listings for unconfirmed or non-existent vacancies
      * listings for any school or trust that is not state funded, that is not in England or that does not teach primary
      or secondary pupils
      * offensive or inappropriate language, including but not limited to profanities or language pejorative of any
      group, such as racist, sexist or homophobic comments
      * discriminatory content: you must not state or imply in a job advert that you will discriminate against anyone
      (subject to certain exceptions under the Equality Act 2010, particularly those applying to schools with a
      religious character); for further information see GOV.UK's [guidance on discrimination in job
      adverts](https://www.gov.uk/employer-preventing-discrimination/recruitment)
      * material that infringes any intellectual property rights, such as copyright and trademarks (this means generally
      that you must own the rights in everything you submit or must obtain permission from the rights owner to submit
      the material)
      * material that is technically harmful (including, without limitation, computer viruses, logic bombs, Trojan
      horses, worms, harmful components, corrupted data or other malicious software or harmful data)
      * material that encourages or teaches conduct that is a criminal offence, gives rise to civil liability, or is
      otherwise unlawful
      {: .govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet }

      ### **Access to the Service**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      We will not be liable if for any reason the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to
      time, we may restrict access to all or some parts of the Service to users who have registered with us.

      If you choose, or are provided with, a user identification code, password or any other piece of information as
      part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to
      any third party.

      We reserve the right to restrict or deny you access to all or some parts of the Service if, in our opinion, you
      have failed to comply with these terms and conditions.

      The Department for Education retains the right to withdraw without notice listings that breach these terms and to
      withdraw the access of users who breach them.

      ### **Listing data**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      Application Programming Interface (API) use: listings are published under the [Open Government
      Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/)
      (OGL), which permits a wide range of information in the public sector to be reused free of charge. This means the
      listing data on Teaching Vacancies will be available to third parties to publish on external sites after the pilot
      phase, aside from where [exceptions to the
      OGL](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/exceptions-to-ogl/)
      prohibit it.

      contained in their listings.

      ### **Terms and conditions for API users**
      {: .govuk-heading-m}

      You are free to reuse job listing data under the terms of the [Open Government
      Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) for public sector
      information with the following exception:

      * You may not charge a school any fee or commission for contacting, interviewing or hiring a respondent to your
      advertisement or listing if it is based on Teaching Vacancies data that you have reused.
