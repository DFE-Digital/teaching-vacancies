  p.govuk-body We sometimes run A/B and multivariate tests to improve our service.

  p.govuk-body
    | In an A/B test we create two versions of a webpage and show some website visitors one and some the other.
    |  This lets us see which version works better for our users.

  p.govuk-body Multivariate tests work in the same way, but use three or more versions of the webpage rather than just two.

  p.govuk-body Below are the versions of webpages that you will see when you browse the Teaching Vacancies website.

  p.govuk-body For more information on our A/B and multivariate tests email #{govuk_mail_to(t("help.email"), t("help.email"))}.
