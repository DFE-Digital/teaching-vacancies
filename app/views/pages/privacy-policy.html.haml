    %h1.govuk-heading-l Privacy Notice: Teaching Vacancies

    %h2.govuk-heading-m Who we are
    %p This work is being carried out by Department for Education (DfE) Digital, which is a part of DfE. DfE engages the private company dxw to help improve and provide the service. For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of Teaching Vacancies. Teaching Vacancies is a free and optional service for schools to advertise teaching roles.

    %h2.govuk-heading-m When we collect personal information
    %p
      We receive your personal data when you submit it:
      %ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        %li when contacting us for support using the service or any other matters
        %li as a headteacher or other authorised person at a school when selecting which hiring staff can create Teaching Vacancies accounts
        %li as hiring staff in order to create a Teaching Vacancies account
        %li as a contact person for a job that has been listed on Teaching Vacancies

    %h2.govuk-heading-m What personal information we will collect
    %p
      We will collect:
      %ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        %li your name, email and (if applicable) your phone number when you contact us
        %li email addresses that are shared with us by schools for the purposes of creating a Teaching Vacancies account and posting jobs
        %li personal information such as the name and email of a contact person at your school, if you choose to share this in a job listing you post to Teaching Vacancies

    %h2.govuk-heading-m How we will use your information
    %p If you contact us, DfE and (where applicable) dxw will use your name and contact information for the purpose of responding to you and providing support. We will not share this information with any other parties.
    %p To list jobs on the service, hiring staff at schools need a Teaching Vacancies account, which requires them to supply their name and email address. Names and email addresses shared with us for this purpose are not shared by us with other parties.
    %p Information published in job listings may be used by third party job listing sites that use our job listing data via an application programming interface (API), as described in our Terms and Conditions. We are not responsible for how a third party handles any personal information you choose to include in a job listing.

    %h2.govuk-heading-m Why our use of your personal data is lawful
    %p In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For the purpose of this project, your consent forms the basis of this as stated under GDPR Article 6 (1)(a).

    %h2.govuk-heading-m Who we will make your personal data available to
    %p We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).
    %p Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data protection legislation. We share specific types of personal data with dxw, who have been contracted by DfE to manage the delivery of the digital service. If you represent a school and are publishing a job listing through Teaching Vacancies we share your email with #{link_to('Microsoft','https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement', class: 'govuk-link')} solely for the purpose of enabling sign-in to the publishing environment.
    %p
      The firm dxw uses your data:
      %ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        %li for user research that informs development of the service, where you have shared your name, email address and/or phone number for this purpose
        %li for security purposes: dxw collects part of the IP addresses of people visiting the Teaching Vacancies website (for example, if we were receiving continuous direct denial of service attacks from an IP address range then we could block it)
        %li to enable users to use the service and receive updates: dxw collects the emails of those publishing job listings on Teaching Vacancies

    %h2.govuk-heading-m How long we will keep your personal data
    %p Neither DfE nor dxw will keep your personal data longer than we need it for the purpose(s) of research, security and/or delivery of the service, and in any case not longer than 7 years. Your data will be deleted when DfE and dxw no longer need it for these purposes, or when 7 years have passed, whichever comes first.
    %p Partial IP addresses will be deleted after 7 days unless their request caused an error, in which case they remain in our logs for 30 days.
    %p If you share personal information in a job listing we will retain this while the job vacancy is live and for one year after it has expired.

    %h2.govuk-heading-m Your data protection rights
    %p
      You have the right:
      %ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
        %li to ask us for access to information about you that we hold
        %li to have your personal data rectified, if it is inaccurate or incomplete
        %li to ask us to delete your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing
        %li to restrict our processing of your personal data (i.e. permitting its storage but no further processing)
        %li to object to direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics
        %li not to be subject to decisions based purely on automated processing where it produces a legal or similarly significant effect on you

    %p If you need to contact us regarding any of the above, or have any other questions about how your personal information will be used, please #{link_to('contact the DfE', 'https://www.gov.uk/contact-dfe', target: '_blank', class: 'govuk-link')}.
    %p The Information Commissioner's Office makes further information about your data protection rights available in their #{link_to('Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)', 'https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/', target: '_blank', class: 'govuk-link')}.

    %h2.govuk-heading-m Withdrawal of consent and the right to lodge a complaint
    %p Where we are processing your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent. If you change your mind, or you are unhappy with our use of your personal data, please let us know by emailing #{mail_to 'teachingjobs@digital.education.gov.uk', 'teachingjobs@digital.education.gov.uk', class: 'govuk-link'}.
    %p You also have the right to raise any concerns with the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO).
