##
# An experimental parser for a vacancy feed.
#
# Allows enumerating over the feed's and yields intialized `Vacancy` objects that can be manipulated
# and persisted by calling code (e.g. an import job).
#
# Notes:
#   - Ruby's `RSS` class doesn't recognise the demo feed as an Atom feed for some reason, so this
#     uses slightly uglier vanilla XML parsing
#   - Until the feed gets modified based on our findings from this spike, we hardcode some fields
#     to example or empty values
#   - We currently don't get a machine-readable identifier for the school through from the feed
#     (although this *will* happen eventually), so we pick a "best guess" school from the children
#     of the feed's school group, and assign the vacancy to the school group itself if we fail
#   - Question: What do we do with vacancies that are removed from the feed - do we need to prune
#     vacancies that no longer come through as part of every update?
