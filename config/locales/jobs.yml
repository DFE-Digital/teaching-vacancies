      suggestions:
        - add more keywords, or try different ones
        - change the radius of your search
        - look at a wider geographical location, West Yorkshire instead of Leeds for example
        - remove some filters if you have used them
    none_listed:
      - This may be because this isn’t a busy period in the teacher recruitment cycle.
      - Schools have listed %{count} jobs but they have since expired.
