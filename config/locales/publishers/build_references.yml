          The post applied for is subject to Regulation 19(3)(a) of the Health and Social Care Act (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014
          which requires us to ensure all “Persons employed” by our organisation (including agency, bank staff and volunteers) must:
        bullets:
          - be of good character
          - have the qualifications, competence, skills, and experience which are necessary for the work to be performed by them, and
          - be able by reason of their health, after reasonable adjustments are made, to properly perform tasks which are intrinsic to the work for which they are employed.
        legal_requirements: >-
          In order to fulfil our legal requirements, we need to make available to CQC:
        legal_bullets:
          - satisfactory evidence of conduct in previous employment concerned with the provision of services relating to health or social care or children or vulnerable adults;
          - satisfactory verification as to reasons why employment ended, if candidate was employed in a position where their duties involved work with children or vulnerable adults.
        essential: >-
          It is therefore essential to require a reference from a previous employer, and the employee cannot be expected to find work of this type unless his or her employer
          provides a full and frank reference to a prospective employer.
        completing: >-
          When completing this reference organisations have a responsibility to ensure that the reference is accurate and does not contain any misstatement and
          nothing significant is omitted.

        gdpr_1: >-
          This form contains personal data as defined by UK GDPR and DPA 2018. It may include special category data (Article 9) and/ criminal offence data (Article 10)
          which has been requested for the purposes of recruitment and safeguarding adults at risk and/or children. As we are the organisation requesting this data,
          we will protect any information disclosed within the form in line with data protection requirements and ensure it is not passed to anyone who is not authorised to see the information.
        gdpr_2: >-
          The content of the reference may be discussed with the candidate; in addition, the candidate may request and be granted access to the reference.
        gdpr_3: >-
          However, if this reference is marked as confidential, the UK GDPR and DPA 2018 creates an exemption from:
        gdpr_bullets:
          - the right to be informed (privacy information)
          - the right to make a subject access request
        gdpr_4: >-
          For example, if this reference is marked as confidential, and the candidate makes a subject access request, both the company who issued it
          and the company who received it would be exempt from having to provide a copy to the candidate.
        gdpr_5: >-
          If this reference is marked confidential, it can only be disclosed to whom it is addressed and cannot be released to a third party.
        gdpr_6: >-
          To ensure that a recruitment process remains open, transparent, and fair to all candidates we request that you only consider using this
          confidential exemption on a case-by-case basis and justify and document reasons below for relying on the confidential exemption
          (for example, the employee was subject to investigation for safeguarding related conduct concerns but left before investigation completed).
        gdpr_7: >-
          Referees also need to be aware that a confidential reference could be subject to disclosure in an employment tribunal or county court claim.
