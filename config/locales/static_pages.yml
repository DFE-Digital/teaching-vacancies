        <p class="govuk-body">We sometimes run A/B and multivariate tests to improve our service.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In an A/B test we create two versions of a webpage and show some website visitors one and some the other. This lets us see which version works better for our users.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Multivariate tests work in the same way, but use three or more versions of the webpage rather than just two.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Below are the versions of webpages that you will see when you browse the Teaching Vacancies website.</p>

          A number of issues related to the accessibility of Teaching Vacancies were raised in an accessibility audit
          conducted in May 2019. All of the issues that fall within the scope of accessibility regulations have been 
          corrected.

              <strong class='strong'>Issue</strong>: The colour used to indicate when an element such as a radio
              button has received focus does not meet the expected ratio.  This is a GDS Design System issue, however,
              so is not within our scope to correct. Note that a subtle movement effect also helps convey the focus
              state of a button, for example, so colour contrast is not the only tactic we use for improving
              distinguishability.<br /><strong class='strong'>Criterion failed</strong>:  1.4.11 Distinguishable:
