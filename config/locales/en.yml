We share specific types of personal data with dxw, who have been contracted by DfE to manage the delivery of the digital service. If you represent a school and are publishing a job listing through Teaching Vacancies we share your email with #{link_to('Microsoft','https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement', class: 'govuk-link')} solely for the purpose of enabling sign-in to the publishing environment.

          - for user research that informs development of the service, where you have shared your name, email address and/or phone number for this purpose
          - 'for security purposes: dxw collects part of the IP addresses of people visiting the Teaching Vacancies website (for example, if we were receiving continuous direct denial of service attacks from an IP address range then we could block it)'

          - Neither DfE nor dxw will keep your personal data longer than we need it for the purpose(s) of research, security and/or delivery of the service, and in any case not longer than 7 years. Your data will be deleted when DfE and dxw no longer need it for these purposes, or when 7 years have passed, whichever comes first.
          - Partial IP addresses will be deleted after 7 days unless their request caused an error, in which case they remain in our logs for 30 days.
          - If you share personal information in a job listing we will retain this while the job vacancy is live and for one year after it has expired.
