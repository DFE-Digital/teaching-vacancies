            purpose of responding to you and providing support. We will not share this information with any other

          - If you sign up for a job alert your email address will be used exclusively for the purpose of sending you
            an email when a job meeting your chosen search criteria is published to the service.
          - To list jobs on the service, hiring staff at schools need a Teaching Vacancies account, which requires them

            shared by us with other parties.
          - Information published in job listings may be used by third party job listing sites that use our job listing

            responsible for how a third party handles any personal information you choose to include in a job listing.

            have passed, whichever comes first.

            remain in our logs for 30 days.
