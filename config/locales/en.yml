          - To list jobs on the service, hiring staff at schools need a Teaching Vacancies account, which requires them to supply their name and email address. Names and email addresses shared with us for this purpose are not shared by us with other parties.
          - Information published in job listings may be used by third party job listing sites that use our job listing data via an application programming interface (API), as described in our Terms and Conditions. We are not responsible for how a third party handles any personal information you choose to include in a job listing.

        title: Who we will make your personal data available to
        line_1: We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).
        line_2: Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data protection legislation. We share specific types of personal data with dxw, who have been contracted by DfE to manage the delivery of the digital service.
        line_3: 'The firm dxw uses your data:'
        list:
          - for user research that informs development of the service, where you have shared your name, email address and/or phone number for this purpose
          - 'for security purposes: dxw collects part of the IP addresses of people visiting the Teaching Vacancies website (for example, if we were receiving continuous direct denial of service attacks from an IP address range then we could block it)'

          - Neither DfE nor dxw will keep your personal data longer than we need it for the purpose(s) of research, security and/or delivery of the service, and in any case not longer than 7 years. Your data will be deleted when DfE and dxw no longer need it for these purposes, or when 7 years have passed, whichever comes first.
          - Partial IP addresses will be deleted after 7 days unless their request caused an error, in which case they remain in our logs for 30 days.
          - If you share personal information in a job listing we will retain this while the job vacancy is live and for one year after it has expired.
