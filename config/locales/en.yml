          This work is being carried out by the Department for Education (DfE) Digital, which is a part of DfE.
          DfE engages the private company Made Tech to help improve and provide the service. For the purpose of data
          protection legislation, DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of
          Teaching Vacancies. Teaching Vacancies is a free and optional service for schools to list teaching roles.

            account and posting jobs

            purpose of responding to you and providing support. We will not share this information with any other
            parties.
          - If you sign up for a job alert your email address will be used exclusively for the purpose of sending you
            an email when a job meeting your chosen search criteria is published to the service.
          - To list jobs on the service, hiring staff at schools need a Teaching Vacancies account, which requires them
            to supply their name and email address. Names and email addresses shared with us for this purpose are not
            shared by us with other parties.
          - Information published in job listings may be used by third party job listing sites that use our job listing
            data via an application programming interface (API), as described in our Terms and Conditions. We are not
            responsible for how a third party handles any personal information you choose to include in a job listing.

            for that purpose. It will not be shared with third parties.

            have passed, whichever comes first.

                button has received focus does not meet the expected ratio.  This is a GDS Design System issue, however,
                so is not within our scope to correct. Note that a subtle movement effect also helps convey the focus
                state of a button, for example, so colour contrast is not the only tactic we use for improving
