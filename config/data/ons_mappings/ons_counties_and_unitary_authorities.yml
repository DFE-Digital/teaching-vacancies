# Mapping from a location name to the type of location to import as

# Counties, Unitary Authorities, and London boroughs are all sourced from the same dataset/endpoint at ONS' API.

# 'other' can refer to a sub-part of a county, e.g. Calderdale which is part of West Yorkshire, or a part of a city,
# e.g. a borough of Manchester, or a unitary authority that doesn't share its name with a city.
