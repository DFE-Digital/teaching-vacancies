# Describes currently running AB tests
#
# A test has a name as its key, and consists of a mapping of variants to weights, e.g.:
#
#    2021_01_another_testing_test:
#      foo: 1
#      bar: 2
#
# In this example, variant `bar` is twice as likely to be selected for any given user
# as variant `foo`.
#
# Things to bear in mind:
#   - Tests must have unique names, including any past tests
#   - Weights must be integers, avoid having too big weights as this may become inefficient
#   - Variants are persisted against a Rails session, so once an AB test has been deployed,
#     you must not remove/rename any existing variants. If you want a variant to receive no
#     new participants, set its weight to 0 instead.
#   - You need to restart your Rails server when changing this file in development
#   - You can add a query parameter such as the below to force a particular variant:
#     ?ab_test_override[2021_01_testing_test]=red
