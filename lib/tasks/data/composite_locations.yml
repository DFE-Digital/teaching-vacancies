# The structure of this file is a dictionary where the keys are the names of locations, and
# the values are lists of the component regions.

# These locations, mostly counties, are often searched, but they are not included in ONS' API
# for county and unitary authority boundaries, which we use to import most county boundaries.
# That API concerns local government divisions, rather than what people commonly think of counties,
# and so excludes what are known as 'ceremonial' or 'geographical' counties:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_counties_of_England

# As of January 2021 I could not find a usable source of ceremonial county boundaries, so I decided
# to construct these out of their component local authorities. I am also including 'Yorkshire',
# which is not a ceremonial county, because it's a common search location.
