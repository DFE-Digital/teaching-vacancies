# Onboarding

## DfE Sign-in

### Hiring staff user in test environment:

* Weydon School (school)

This user will be available for [Teaching Vacancies QA environment site](https://qa.teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/) and local development.

### Production Support user:
A team member with approver rights in [DfE Sign-in production environment](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/) invites the new developer to Teaching Vacancies support team.

This user allows the developer to visit the [Teaching Vacancies production support dashboard](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/support-users), that provides access to the [production user feedback](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/support-users/feedback/general) and [sidekiq](https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/sidekiq) dashboards.
